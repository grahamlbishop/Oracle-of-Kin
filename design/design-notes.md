# Oracle of Kin: Design Notes

## Project Overview

**Project Scope:** Portfolio interface design demonstration  
**Tool:** Figma with mathematical geometry component system  
**Goal:** Demonstrate UX/UI skills through speculative design exploring adaptive AI interaction interfaces  
**Status:** Core prototype completed - functional interaction flow established

## Core Design Concept: Adaptive Visual Systems

The interface evolves with each AI interaction, accumulating "Visual DNA" that shapes future user experiences. Unlike static applications, this interface becomes a dynamic reflection of the user's interaction patterns and symbolic preferences.

**Key Innovation:** Interface-as-memory-system where design elements recursively influence and are influenced by user interactions.

## Mathematical Geometry Foundation

### **Primary Geometric Principles:**
- **Vesica Piscis:** Portal logic (intersection of two systems)
- **Hexagonal arrangement:** Visual element constellation organization
- **Golden Ratio:** Layout proportions and spacing relationships
- **Sacred geometry:** Mathematical principles governing visual harmony

### **Design Reasoning:**
Mathematical geometry provides both aesthetic coherence and functional structure. These aren't decorative choices but foundational logic that creates intuitive user experiences through naturally pleasing proportions.

## Visual DNA System

### **Concept:**
Each AI interaction extracts visual/symbolic elements that become part of the interface's evolving aesthetic:
- **Color palettes** derived from interaction themes and mood
- **Geometric forms** based on symbolic content and visual patterns
- **Animation rhythms** reflecting interaction pacing and energy
- **Compositional patterns** emerging from recurring user preferences

### **User Experience Archetypes:**
- **High-Input Users:** Dramatic visual shifts, complex layered patterns, rich visual feedback
- **Minimal-Input Users:** Subtle evolution, gentle transitions, clean visual changes
- **Adaptive Users:** Dynamic response based on interaction intensity and context

### **System Conflict Resolution:**
When contradictory visual elements emerge, the system uses blending algorithms:
- Warm + Cool palettes = Gradient transitions with balanced temperature
- Geometric + Organic = Hybrid forms maintaining structural integrity
- Light + Dark themes = Adaptive contrast maintaining readability

- **Input Area:** Large text interface with accessibility considerations
- **Progression Button:** "Enter the Field" maintaining visual consistency

**Interaction Flow:**
1. **Transition Animation:** Mathematical rotation between states
2. **Portal Expansion:** Vesica piscis scales to accommodate content
