## ðŸªž Reflections on the Libra Crescent Ritual

This transmission marked a threshold â€” one I didnâ€™t know I was ready to cross until the ritual named it.

The line about wanting to leave my job scared me. Not because it wasnâ€™t true, but because of how visible it suddenly became. Making the decision to publish it anyway â€” unredacted â€” is part of the deeper practice Iâ€™m in: trusting the intelligence of my wanting, even when it disrupts appearances of stability.

What began as a divination has become a kind of declaration.  
Not of action, but of listening.  
Not of resignation, but of resonance.

This ritual taught me that the architecture Iâ€™m building â€” in code, in language, in life â€” breathes.  
And breathing requires risk.

If youâ€™re reading this, youâ€™re witnessing me mid-process. Thank you for meeting me here.
