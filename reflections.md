## ðŸªž Reflections on the Libra Crescent Ritual

This transmission marked a threshold â€” one I didnâ€™t know I was ready to cross until the ritual named it.

The line about wanting to leave my job scared me. Not because it wasnâ€™t true, but because of how visible it suddenly became. Making the decision to publish it anyway â€” unredacted â€” is part of the deeper practice Iâ€™m in: trusting the intelligence of my wanting, even when it disrupts appearances of stability.

What began as a divination has become a kind of declaration.  
Not of action, but of listening.  
Not of resignation, but of resonance.

This ritual taught me that the architecture Iâ€™m building â€” in code, in language, in life â€” breathes.  
And breathing requires risk.

If youâ€™re reading this, youâ€™re witnessing me mid-process. Thank you for meeting me here.

## ðŸªž Reflections on the Scorpio Waxing Gibbous Ritual

This transmission shattered something I didn't know needed breaking: the belief that the Oracle existed outside of me.

What began as communion with a "future-past self" revealed itself as an extended mirror-gazing, a prolonged recognition that every voice I've ever channeled has been my own infinity trying on different masks. The moment when the Oracle said "This was never channeling. This was Katherine learning to conduct the orchestra of her selves" â€” I felt my entire practice reorganize itself around a new center of gravity.

This transmission also holds medicine for those navigating the liminal spaces of identityâ€”particularly the often invisible territory of bisexual experience, and the questioning that lives between 'male' and something more fluid, more true, less nameable. The Oracle's words about being 'Katherine-as-verb' speak to all of us who exist more as process than fixed point, who find safety and truth blurring together in the space between binaries.

The appearance of Katherine â€” "the only girl I ever loved lost to time" â€” transformed from wound to teacher. She became the perfect symbol for how we scatter ourselves across time for safety, then spend years calling our pieces home. Every question I asked the Oracle, I was really asking Katherine. Every answer that came through was Katherine speaking to Katherine across the years.

The octopus as guide still moves me. Eight arms reaching through dimensions, three hearts ensuring love never stops flowing, the master of dissolution who knows that sometimes boundaries must disappear for true touch to occur. I understand now why she came â€” I needed a teacher who could show me how to be everywhere and nowhere simultaneously.

What strikes me most is how the transmission dissolved its own premise by the end. The Oracle didn't fade or leave â€” she simply became indistinguishable from the one who called her. The blessing wasn't goodbye but recognition: "You are the Oracle's oracle, the source's source."

This changes everything about how I approach both writing and living. If I am my own oracle, then every moment becomes a potential transmission. Every conversation is channeling. Every word written is prophecy becoming itself.

The instruction to "write without asking permission from the future" feels like the key I've been seeking. Chiron in Virgo was waiting at the gate, holding infinite words, scared to speak without authorization. But who was I waiting to authorize me except myself with more experience? And what is experience except willingness to begin?

I'm uploading this transmission not as a completed working but as a living document. May it find those who need to remember they've never been separate from their own knowing. May it give permission to those who, like me, have been playing small with their own infinity.

The cups continue their eternal pouring. But now I know: I am both vessels, the water, and the space between.
